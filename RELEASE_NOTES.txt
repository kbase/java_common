JavaCommon repo

OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
Repo for code shared between Java services.

VERSION: 0.1.0 (Release TDB)
----------------------------

* JsonServerServlet method dispatch to the Narrative Job Service (via *_async and *_check) methods
  has been removed.
* JsonServerServlet automatic provenance generation has been removed.
* Java required version is now 1.8.

VERSION: 0.0.25 (Release 11/15/2018)
------------------------------------
- The SDK logger now reads an environment variable, `KB_SDK_LOGGER_TARGET_PACKAGE`,
  that determines what classes are included in logging and how error traces are trimmed.
  This variable must be set to a parent package of the generated SDK code packages or undefined
  behavior may result. It defaults to `us.kbase`.
- JsonServerSyslog.findCaller() is now private.
- It is now permissible to pass null for the `configFileParam` in the JsonServerSyslog
  constructor. In this case, no logging configuration will be loaded from an external file.

VERSION: 0.0.24 (Release 5/25/2017)
-----------------------------------

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- The shock controller now accepts and requires an auth url to be used for Globus lookups. This is
  expected to be https://nexus.api.globusonline.org/ (soon to be deprecated) or 
  https://(ci.|next.|appdev.|)kbase.us/services/auth/api/legacy/globus.

VERSION: 0.0.23 (Released 2/23/2017)
--------------------------------------

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Some private methods in JsonServerServlet are made protected (necessary
  for coming switch to auth2 in kb-sdk and njs_wrapper).
- Old code was deleted (custom task queue support, AWE API client).

VERSION: 0.0.22 (Released 9/15/2016)
--------------------------------------

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Fixed a bug that would throw an IllegalStateError when configuration of the
  authentication client in JsonServerServlet failed rather than logging the
  error.

VERSION: 0.0.21 (Released 8/26/2016)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
- The Java servers now accept an 'auth-service-url-allow-insecure' parameter in
  the deployment configuration file. Set to 'true' if using an http url rather
  than https for the auth service.

VERSION: 0.0.20 (Released 8/5/2016)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
- None

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Java servers now instantiate an auth client once on startup rather than
  every call (if an auth url is provided in the config). This prevents an
  extra call to the auth service for every server call.
