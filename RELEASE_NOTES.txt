  Artifactory.

VERSION: 0.0.24 (Release 5/25/2017)
-----------------------------------

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- The shock controller now accepts and requires an auth url to be used for Globus lookups. This is
  expected to be https://nexus.api.globusonline.org/ (soon to be deprecated) or 
  https://(ci.|next.|appdev.|)kbase.us/services/auth/api/legacy/globus.

VERSION: 0.0.23 (Released 2/23/2017)
--------------------------------------

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:

  for coming switch to auth2 in kb-sdk and njs_wrapper).

VERSION: 0.0.22 (Released 9/15/2016)
--------------------------------------

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
- Fixed a bug that would throw an IllegalStateError when configuration of the
  authentication client in JsonServerServlet failed rather than logging the
  error.

VERSION: 0.0.21 (Released 8/26/2016)
--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:

  than https for the auth service.

--------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
- None

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
